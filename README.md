README: Portfolio Optimization using Markowitz MPT with Sharpe Ratio Maximization

Introduction

This project implements Markowitz Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) with constrained optimization to construct portfolios maximizing the Sharpe Ratio. The approach balances expected returns against volatility while incorporating real-world constraints like sector caps, asset concentration limits, and liquidity requirements.

math
\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p}
Where:

$R_p$ = Portfolio return
$R_f$ = Risk-free rate (3-month Treasury ^IRX)
$\sigma_p$ = Portfolio volatility
